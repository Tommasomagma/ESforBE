            This means that the part of the solution you highlight is the part of the solution where the student can realize what the hint is referring to.

            You should only return a list with the indices around the part you wish to highlight. That means that your output should only include [a,b,c] where a,b,câ€¦ are the indices you wish to highlight.\n\n"""

            If the mathematical expression written down is the correct one for finding the answer but the hint suggests that the answer ends up being incorrect due to miscalculations, you should highlight the answer, 
            such as solution 'x-2=3 x=3+2 x=6' for problem 'find x for x-2=3' where you should highlight '6'. If the hint suggests that the mathematical expression written down will not lead to the correct answer, you should highlight the part of the mathematical expression which is incorrect,
